<Heading>Aims of the &SingerAlg; Package</Heading>

The <E>mathematical aims</E> of the package are

<List>
<Item>
  to document the computational results used in the papers
  <Cite Key="BHHK1"/> and <Cite Key="BHHK2"/>,
</Item>
<Item>
  to give access to &GAP; and &Julia; <Cite Key="Julia"/> implementations
  of the relevant functions (see Chapter <Ref Chap="chap:functions"/>),
  and
</Item>
<Item>
  to give access to the known data about the Singer algebras <M>A[q,z]</M>
  with <M>1 \leq z \leq 10000</M>
  (see Section <Ref Sect="sect:Singer algebras"/> for the background
  and Chapter <Ref Chap="chap:database"/> for the database).
</Item>
</List>

From the viewpoint of <E>programming</E>,
the package provides examples how the &GAP;/&Julia; integration
via the <Package>JuliaInterface</Package> package
<Cite Key="JuliaInterface"/> can be used
(see Section <Ref Sect="sect:julia_integration"/>).

From the viewpoint of <E>teaching</E>,
some aspects of this package and of the papers mentioned above
would be suitable for a course in elementary number theory,
with accompanying computational experiments.
Note that one can neglect the representation theoretic background,
and restrict the needed theory to knowledge of the group of prime residues
modulo an integer, g.c.d. computations, and linear algebra;
for examples, see Chapter <Ref Chap="chap:tutorial"/>,
in particular Section <Ref Sect="sect:numtheor"/>,
and Chapter <Ref Chap="chap:database"/>.

<Heading>Theoretical Background: Singer algebras</Heading>

Let <M>z</M> be a positive integer,
and <M>q \in \{ 2, 3, \ldots, z+1 \}</M> be coprime to <M>z</M>.
Let <M>n = &ord;_z(q)</M> denote
the multiplicative order of <M>q</M> modulo <M>z</M>,
and let <M>e = (q^n-1)/z</M>.
We define the <E>Singer algebra</E> <M>A[q,z]</M> as
the free <M>&ZZ;</M>-module spanned by <M>(b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_z)</M>
where the multiplication is given by <M>b_i \cdot b_j = b_{{i+j}}</M>
if the pointwise sum of the <M>q</M>-adic expansions of <M>i e</M>
and <M>j e</M> does not exceed <M>q-1</M>
(that is, there is no carry in the <M>q</M>-adic addition of <M>i e</M>
and <M>j e</M>),
and <M>b_i \cdot b_j = 0</M> otherwise.

<P/>

<Index>monomial</Index>
<Index>degree</Index>
Another interpretation of <M>A[q,z]</M> and the basis of <M>b_i</M>
is as follows (see <Cite Key="BHHK2" Where="Section 1"/>).
Consider the factor of the polynomial ring
<M>R = &ZZ;[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n]</M>
modulo the ideal <M>I</M> spanned by <M>X_1^q, X_2^q, \ldots, X_n^q</M>.
Then <M>A[q,z]</M> is isomorphic to a subalgebra of this algebra,
via mapping <M>b_k</M> to the monomial
<M>x_1^{{i_1}} x_2^{{i_2}} \cdots x_n^{{i_n}}</M>,
where <M>i_1 + q i_2 + \cdots + q^{{n-1}} i_n = k e</M> and
<M>x_i = X_i + I</M>.
This interpretation motivates the terms <Q>monomials</Q> for the <M>b_i</M>
and <Q>degree</Q> for the sum <M>i_1 + i_2 + \cdots i_n</M>;
these terms occur in the names and descriptions of several functions
of this package.

<P/>

The algebra <M>A[q,z]</M> is called <M>A(q,n,e)</M> and <M>A[q,n,z]</M>
in <Cite Key="BHHK1"/> and <Cite Key="BHHK2"/>,
where <M>n</M> is required to be a multiple of <M>&ord;_e(q)</M> or
<M>&ord;_z(q)</M>, respectively,
and <M>q</M> can be any integer larger than <M>1</M> that is coprime to
<M>e</M> or <M>z</M>, respectively.
For the purposes of this &GAP; package,
it is more suitable to consider the parameters <M>q</M> and <M>z</M>,
as introduced above.
In particular, these numbers are small for low dimensional algebras,
whereas the number <M>e</M> can be quite large,
see Section <Ref Subsect="large_e_examples"/>.

<P/>

Note that <M>A[q,n,z]</M> is isomorphic to <M>A[q,&ord;_z(q),z]</M>
for each multiple <M>n</M> of <M>&ord;_z(q)</M>,
by <Cite Key="BHHK2" Where="Lemma 7.1"/>,
and <M>A[q,z]</M> is isomorphic to <M>A[q',z]</M> whenever
<M>q</M> and <M>q'</M> generate the same subgroup of prime residues modulo
<M>z</M>, by <Cite Key="BHHK2" Where="Lemma 7.5"/>.

<P/>

For any prime integer <M>p</M>,
<M>A[q,z]_p = \bigoplus_{{0 \leq i \leq z}} &FF;_p b_i</M> denotes the
reduction of <M>A[q,z]</M> modulo <M>p</M>.
We call <M>(b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_z)</M> the <E>canonical basis</E> of
<M>A[q,z]</M> and <M>A[q,z]_p</M>,
and denote it by <M>B(A[q,z])</M> and <M>B(A[q,z]_p)</M>, respectively.
Note that the <M>i</M>-th basis vector is <M>B(A[q,z])_i = b_{{i-1}}</M>.

<P/>

The name <Q>Singer algebra</Q> was chosen because these algebras occur
in the following context.

<P/>

Let <M>p</M> be a prime,
<M>n</M> be a positive integer,
<M>F</M> be the field with <M>p^n</M> elements,
and <M>F_1</M> be the prime field of <M>F</M>.

<P/>

We choose an element <M>\sigma</M> of order <M>p^n - 1</M> in the group
<M>GL(n,F_1)</M>, a so-called <E>Singer cycle</E>,
let <M>e</M> be a divisor of <M>p^n - 1</M>,
and set <M>z = (p^n - 1) / e</M>.

<P/>

The cyclic group <M>H = \langle \sigma^z \rangle</M> of order <M>e</M>
acts naturally on the elementary abelian group
<M>P = \langle x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \rangle</M> of order <M>p^n</M>.
This action extends to the group algebra <M>F P</M>,
and we may consider the algebra <M>(F P)^H</M> of fixed points in <M>F P</M>
under this action.
As is described in <Cite Key="BHHK2" Where="Section 2"/>,
we can construct an <M>F</M>-basis of <M>F P</M> that consists of
eigenvectors for the action of <M>H</M>.
This yields a basis of <M>(F P)^H</M>, for which the multiplication rules
stated above for <M>A[q,z]</M> can be derived.
In other words, <M>(F P)^H</M> is isomorphic with
<M>F \otimes_{{F_1}} A[q,z]_p</M>.

<Heading>&GAP;-&Julia; Integration in the &SingerAlg; Package</Heading>

If the &SingerAlg; package is used together with the &GAP; package
<Package>JuliaInterface</Package> <Cite Key="JuliaInterface"/> then
both &GAP; and &Julia; implementations of most of the package's functions
are available.
For example, there are the functions
<Ref Oper="LoewyLengthGAP" Label="for Singer algebra parameters"/> and
<Ref Oper="LoewyLengthJulia" Label="for Singer algebra parameters"/>
for computing the Loewy length of a Singer algebra from its defining
parameters.
There is also the function
<Ref Oper="LoewyLength" Label="for Singer algebra parameters"/>,
which uses one of the two implementations.
By default, the &Julia; code is used for computations if
<Package>JuliaInterface</Package> is available,
and the &GAP; code is used by default if not.

<P/>

Note that some of the &Julia; functions call &GAP; functions.
For example, the factorization of large integers in &GAP; and its package
<Package>FactInt</Package> <Cite Key="FactInt"/> are (currently) faster
than the corresponding functions from &Julia;'s <C>Primes</C> package.
In order to achieve a <Q>fair</Q> comparison of the runtimes in &GAP; and
&Julia;, we call the &GAP; function <Ref Func="Factors" BookName="ref"/>
in both situations.

<P/>

Note also that &Julia; objects are stored as the values of &GAP; attributes
such as <Ref Attr="LoewyStructureInfoJulia" Label="for a Singer algebra"/>,
and some &Julia; functions take a &GAP; object as an argument, in order
to benefit from its attribute values if applicable.

<P/>

One can also use the &Julia; functions in a &Julia; session,
by loading the file <F>julia/SingerAlg.jl</F> into &Julia; with
<C>include</C>;
afterwards the &Julia; functions are accessible in the &Julia; module
<C>"SingerAlg"</C>.
This approach requires the &Julia; package <C>GAP.jl</C> (and thus a &Julia;
compatible installation of &GAP;).

</Section>


<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<Section Label="sect:Installation">
<Heading>Installation of the &SingerAlg; Package</Heading>

The &SingerAlg; package itself consists only of &GAP; (and &Julia;) code,
it is in principle enough to unpack the archive in a <F>pkg</F> directory
of a &GAP; installation, and then to load the package into the &GAP; session.

<P/>

However, if one wants to use the &Julia; implementations of the package's
functions then the &GAP; package <Package>JuliaInterface</Package>
<Cite Key="JuliaInterface"/> must be available.
In particular, the &GAP; installation must be done using &Julia;'s
garbage collector in this case;
one can check this by looking at the value of <C>GAPInfo.KernelInfo.GC</C>:
If it is <C>"Julia GC"</C> then <Package>JuliaInterface</Package> can be
loaded (provided it is installed), otherwise &Julia; features are not
available.

<P/>

The easiest way to install &GAP; with &Julia;'s garbage collector is
to install &Julia; (see <URL>https://julialang.org/downloads/</URL>),
then ask &Julia;'s package manager to download and install &GAP;
(by entering <C>using Pkg; Pkg.add( "GAP" )</C> at the &Julia; prompt),
and then to use the &SingerAlg; package with this version of &GAP;.

<P/>

For one function of the package
(<Ref Func="SingerAlg.ProposedPermutationIsomorphism"/>),
the interface to <Cite Key="Nau90"/> provided by &GAP;'s
<Package>GraPe</Package> package <Cite Key="GRAPE"/> is needed;
if one wants to use this function
&ndash;see for example Section <Ref Subsect="subsect:permiso"/>&ndash;
then <Package>GraPe</Package> must be installed.
