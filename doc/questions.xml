   Easy task:
   Formulate the theoretic proofs of isomorphism for Loewy vector
   <M>(1,k,1,\ldots,1)</M> for the special case of Singer algebras,
   remove the conditions on characteristic and fact that alg. closed.
   (How do the b_i map to the x_i, y_j in the proof in the paper?)
</Item>
<Item>
   Loewy length formula for <M>n = 4</M>?
   (If the bound is not attained then <M>e = 2e_1</M>, and ...)
   Look at more examples and hope for a counterexample,
   or try a theoretical proof?
</Item>
<Item>
   Is there an infinite series of parameter pairs
   <M>(q,z)</M>, <M>(q',z)</M> with the same Loewy vector such that
   <M>A[q,z]</M> and <M>A[q',z]</M> are nonisomorphic?
   (The examples with <M>z = 117 p</M> for small primes <M>p</M>
   could look promising.)
</Item>
<Item>
   Classification of
   <M>|\{ s_q(ke); 1 \leq k &lt; z \}| = 1</M>?
   (Under this condition, we have <M>s_q(ke) = n(q-1)/2</M>
   for all <M>1 \leq k &lt; z</M>.
   Is this condition equivalent to <M>(q^{{n/2}}-1 \mid e</M>?)
</Item>
<Item>
   Does the bound hold for <M>e</M> dividing <M>(q^6-1)/(q-1)</M>?
</Item>
<Item>
   Is there a closed formula for the Loewy length in case <M>n = 3</M>,
   analogous to the one in ... for <M>n = 2</M>?
</Item>
<Item>
   How many isomorphism types of algebras <M>A(q,n,e)</M> can exist
   if the Loewy length is <M>4</M>?
</Item>
<Item>
   For which values of <M>z</M> do we have open cases
   in the classification by isomorphism types?
   (patterns?)
</Item>
<Item>
   Is it possible that <M>A[q,k n,z]</M> and <M>A[q^k,n,z]</M> have the same
   Loewy vector but are not naturally isomorphic?

   Note that in this case, one direction is clear:
   No overflow in addition mod <M>q</M> implies no overflow in
   addition mod <M>q^k</M> for corresponding pairs of basis vectors.
   For the other direction, one would need that in case of an overflow
   mod <M>q</M> in one position where there is no overflow mod <M>q^k</M>,
   there is another position in the coefficient vector where one has also
   overflow mod <M>q^k</M>.

   (Look at example <M>A[9,6,65]</M> vs. <M>A[3,12,65]</M>:
   The only pairs of coefficients mod 9
   where one has overflow mod 3 but not mod 9
   are (1,2), (1,5), (2,2), (2,4), (2,5).)
</Item>

   Is it possible that two Singer algebras are nonisomorphic over
   the ring of integers, but they have isomorphic reduction modulo
   some prime integer?
</Item>
<Item>
   Why does the expression
   <C>"Prod(Root0(3,1),Root0(2,1))"</C>
   not describe a valid invariant?
   (Is there an example in the database that documents this,
   that is, a pair of isomorphic Singer algebras for which the
   corresponding formal subspace has different dimensions?)

I had computed that $A[29,6,117]$ and $A[35,6,117]$ are not isomorphic.
Note that both algebras have the Loewy vector $[ 1, 104, 12, 1 ]$,
that the ``cheap invariants'' are the same,
and that one can distinguish the two algebras by considering the algebras
over the field with two elements and then counting the numbers
of pairs $(a,b) \in J \times J$ with the property that $a b = c^2$
for some $c \in J$ are different.

The latter criterion to decide whether two algebras are isomorphic or not
looks feasible only if the dimension of $J^2$ is small.
Looking at the open cases with $\dim( J^2 )= 12$ yields the following
list of nonisomorphic algebras $A[q_1,n_1,z]$, $A[q_2,n_2,z]$
with Loewy vector $[ 1, z-13, 12, 1 ]$.

   q_1 | n_1 | q_2 | n_2 |    z | z/117
----------------------------------------
    29 |   6 |  35 |   6 |  117 |     1
    29 |  30 |  35 |  30 | 1287 |    11
    29 |  78 |  35 |  78 | 1521 |    13
    29 |  48 | 107 |  48 | 1989 |    17
    29 |  18 |  35 |  18 | 2223 |    19
    29 |  66 |  35 |  66 | 2691 |    23
   113 |  84 |  35 |  42 | 3393 |    29
    29 |  30 | 152 |  30 | 3627 |    31
   113 |  36 |  35 |  36 | 4329 |    37
    29 | 120 |  35 | 120 | 4797 |    41
    29 |  42 |  35 |  42 | 5031 |    43
    29 | 138 |  35 | 138 | 5499 |    47
    29 |  78 |  35 | 156 | 6201 |    53
    29 | 174 |  35 | 174 | 6903 |    59
   113 |  30 |  35 |  60 | 7137 |    61
   113 |  66 |  35 |  66 | 7839 |    67
    29 | 210 |  35 | 210 | 8307 |    71
    29 |  72 |  35 |  36 | 8541 |    73
    29 |  78 |  35 |  78 | 9243 |    79
    29 | 246 |  35 | 246 | 9711 |    83

Note that the smallest examples $A[29,6,117]$ and $A[35,6,117]$ occur as
subalgebras in the bigger cases.
(We have $A[107,6,117] \cong A[35,6,117] \cong A[152,6,117]$ and
$A[113,6,117] \cong A[29,6,117]$.)
Even the computed numbers of pairs, restricted to the subspaces where
conditions on the coefficients exist, are the same as in the smallest
examples.
